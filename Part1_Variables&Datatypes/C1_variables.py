# Variables and variable declaration

x=10                    # integer or float
y="Hello World"         # strings
booli=True              # Boolean values
print("x equal to: ",(x),"\ny equals to: ",(y),"\nbooli equals to: ",(booli))


a=[12,10,15,12]         # Lists
b=['1st string','2nd string','3rd string']
c=[10,45,'any string',45,'other string']
print(f"a equals to: {a} \nb equals to: {b} \nc equals to: {c}")

# Multiple variable in a single line
d,e,f=10,12,13
print(f"d = {d} \ne = {e} \nf = {f}")

# Correct variable declaration
    # alphabets {a,b,c,d,...x,y,z,A,B,C,...X,Y,Z} [prefered x,y,z]
    # strings {variable,variable_one,variable_1,}

# Wrong variable declaration
    # starting with numbers {1,2,1_a,2_x,1_variable}
    # using some special characters {#,-,!,$,%,variable-1,variable 2}
